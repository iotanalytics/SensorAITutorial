# IoTTutorial
This project is dedicated to building a complete tutorial of advanced signal processing methods only for time series data. Every method in it covers the introduction, theory, application, and handy code.

## Running the code

Most of the code for this book is in Jupyter notebooks.
If you are not familiar with Jupyter, you can run a tutorial by [clicking here](https://jupyter.org/try).  
Then select "Try Classic Notebook".  
It will open a notebook with instructions for getting started.

To run the ThinkDSP code, you can run the notebooks on Google Colab.
